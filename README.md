# Data from Performance Analysis of OpenVPN on a Consumer Grade Router
Performance case study of OpenVPN on a consumer router (CSE 567M project data/code)

This repository contains data, experimental results, and supporting code for the class project paper titled:

**“Performance Analysis of OpenVPN on a Consumer Grade Router”**  
CSE 567M: Computer Systems Analysis  
Washington University in St. Louis – Fall 2008  
Instructor: Dr. Raj Jain  
Author: Michael J. Hall

The paper is available online on [Dr. Jain's course website](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-08/ftp/ovpn/index.html) and will also be submitted to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

The data, experimental results, and scripts in this repository were originally created and collected in **November 2008** as part of the course project. This GitHub repository serves as a permanent archival copy of that work.

## Overview

This project investigates the performance characteristics of OpenVPN running on a consumer-grade router under various configurations and workloads.

## Repository Contents

- `data/`  
  Raw and processed data from experiments, including throughput, latency, and CPU usage measurements.

- `scripts/`  
  Bash and Python scripts used to run experiments, collect data, and analyze the results.

- `configs/`  
  OpenVPN server and client configuration files used during testing.
