# OpenVPN SERVER configuration using the TAP interface in a multi-client / server setup
# - Bridged network  --  All clients connecting to the server will effectively be on the local area
#                        network of the server itself.
# - Created on a Linux server
# - The server configuration requires a bridged interface.  On Linux, this requires that the bridge-utils
#   package be installed on the system.  Also, bridge start and stop scripts need to be edited that were
#   provided by OpenVPN.
